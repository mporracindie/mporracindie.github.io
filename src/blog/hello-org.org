** Indeed

This post was originally written with org-mode syntax, instead of [[file:goodbye-markdown][markdown]].

As you can see, /italics/ and *bold* render as expected, and you can even use footnotes[fn:1].

All of this is powered by [[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]], btw[fn:2].

Let's look at some code:

#+begin_src python
import os

def hello():
  print("Hello World!")
  os.exit(0)

hello()
#+end_src

** Notes

[fn:1] See?

[fn:2] And another one footnote, to stay on the safe side.
